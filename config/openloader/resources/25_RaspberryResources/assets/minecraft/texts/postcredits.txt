ยงf"hey! if you're reading this, thank you. i really appreciate it. as someone with next to no coding knowledge, this project has been absolute hell to develop at times, but i've persevered thanks to the encouragement and motivation given to me by my friends and everyone enjoying it. i consider this to not just be a neat little modpack, but a love letter to everything i enjoy about minecraft and its community, and a way to show what can be achieved with even the smallest bit of extra effort and vision. it's never been my intention to make it a very formal project bogged down by over-professionalism, but instead to keep it as something fun for everyone, including myself - and i think i've done alright. thanks for reading, and see you soon!" ยง7- raspmary
