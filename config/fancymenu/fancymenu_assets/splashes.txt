This text is impossible to read no matter what resolution your game is at, because it's ludicrously long just for the sake of this joke. Now I have to fill in more empty space for the joke to actually make sense. Uh, hello! If you're reading this, you're probably doing it through the splashes text file. Did you know that the splashes text file is in a different location as of Raspberry Flavoured 2.2 pre-release 2? Yeah, I figured just having it here would be much simpler. And it seems I was right - I mean, would you be reading this splash now if it was still buried all the way under all the resource pack files? Well, you're welcome!
